# H4ZEL MINI

This will be a mini implementation of some core Hazel architectural features, including:
- Collaborative editing (described [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3704909))
- Incremental statics (described [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.08946))
- Projectors
- Maybe more

There are no language features to speak of. This codebase exists to help us work out the implementation and interaction of the architectural components without the overhead of sophisticated language features and UI.
